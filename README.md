# ParBal
Parallel energy balance model

This is the latest version of the Parallel Energy Balance (ParBal) model. Using snow cover and downscaled metereological forcings, it produces daily snow melt and reconstructed snow water equivalent (SWE). Note, the snowmelt is valid year-round, but the SWE is only valid during the ablation season, from its peak (maximum) through melt out.
